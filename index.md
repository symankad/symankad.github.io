<h1>Taking a Passport Photo</h1>

<h3>You can get your own passport photo that meets U.S. Department of State requirements.</h3>

Plan to take the photo no more than six months before you apply for a passport.
You will need the following:
- A friend to help you take the photo
- Digital camera
- Computer
- Photo printer

1. Wear clothing that you normally wear on a daily basis.
    Do not wear a uniform, unless you wear one for religious reasons everyday.

2. To make sure that you do not hide your head or hair, do the following:
- Remove any dark or tinted glasses that are not medically necessary.
- Take off a head covering, unless you wear it for religious reasons.
- Take off headphones, wireless hands-free devices, and similar devices.
  You may wear any prescription glasses that you use everyday, and you may keep your
  hearing aid on.
  
3. Stand in front of a white or off-white background.

4. Face the camera directly.
  Avoid glare on prescription glasses by tilting the glasses downward, removing the
  glasses, or turning off the camera flash.

5. Have a neutral facial expression and both eyes open, and then have your friend take the
photo.

6. Transfer the photo from the camera to your computer.

7. Use a passport photo editing tool on the computer to crop the photo to 2 x 2 inches (51
x 51 mm) in size such that the height of the head is between 1 inch and 1 3/8 inches
(between 25 and 35 mm) from the bottom of the chin to the top of hair. Print the photo
on photo quality paper.
  
  You now have an acceptable photo to go with your passport application!
